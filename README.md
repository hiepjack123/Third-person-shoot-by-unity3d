# Third-person-shooter-by-unity3d
This is a project I made after reading the book Unity3d in English and use my basic knowledge about C# programming after about 3 months. 
I hope I able to make another project better than this one by using better computational algorithm and optimize it.
There maybe more fixing in the gameplay when i try to make the alien becomes normal because the alien is very weird. Real game when we realize the alien can survive from the Marine's bullet not just one shot
The scene of this game is not more complicated. Maybe I just beginner so I keep doing like the book and add some gameplays for fun
As you can see I dont know how to make player textures and models from designing software so we just borrow existing models in this book
The source I use I eddit codes from the game because some are so stupid. After 3 months I finished it after the demo of FPS game. 
The first project have some fun addtional features like you can aim, can reload, make skeleton enemy chase you to die.Ofcourse I know they are still stupid
So we get to the main point after my long description ^^ haha
* Note: Dont get me wrong this project first is not mine but I try to make it better and different from the demo project.
So the first idea of this project is "SURVIVAL" and ofcourse life is precious xD. So the game we play we just hit and run aliens( there are many)
In the beggining we in the area and it has aliens which chase us and try to kill us. The support items will appear randomly after time.
Pick up items will upgrade your gun and your power then you can easily wipe aliens out and survive.To play the game you we have Unity cause I haven't build it yet. Sorry for uncovenient.
*Note: Use A W S D to move your character. Try to survive wave spawn pick up will appearn try to find it and upgrade your power.
Alien can run behind your. They are extremely dangerous. Try to avoid them.
